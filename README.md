# go-fcm-scraping
This is a concurrent web scraper written in Go designed to scout for high-potential young players from fifacm.com. It efficiently fetches data for multiple teams, filters players based on configurable criteria (like minimum potential and growth), and saves the results to a clean JSON file.
